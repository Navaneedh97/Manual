<h2> Chest Muscles(Internal)</h2>
<p>The chest muscles are made up of the pectoralis major and, underneath that, the pectoralis minor.1﻿ Together they are often referred to as the "pecs." The pectoralis major is the larger muscle and has two parts—an upper portion (called the clavicular head) and the lower portion (called the sternal head). The pectoralis minor is triangular in shape and works in tandem with the pectoralis major.

The chest muscles are responsible for moving the arms across the body and up and down, as well as other movements like flexion, adduction, and rotation.
